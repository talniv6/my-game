# my-game
This in-process game is an RPG game (like the old and amazing pokemon games, same style) which is a thinking game. 
The riddles are in escape room style and requires out-of-the-box thinking in order to be solved. 
Right now there are two stages.   
I'm using libgdx library.    
The game is intended to run on android devices and desktop.    
     
the code of the game can be found on 'core' directory
